<h1>Extermination</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
    Our game is a 2-D shooter game. The goal of our game is to get to a certain distance and kill all of the original zombies chasing you. While you are running towards the end you will encounter obstacles, such as: zombies and debris blocking your way. Your primary obstacle are the zombies though. From the start there will be lots of them chasing you down, and then stronger ones will be spawning randomly in front of you. You will be able to attack them. Of course, you will lose if you get overwhelmed by the zombies. The player will use the w,a,s,d keys or arrow keys to move the character. Left click on the mouse will be used to shoot, there will be a crosshair.
